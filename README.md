# numetric

The numetric library provides a UnitValue class for representing physical quantities that have both a value and an associated unit. 
The UnitValue class overloads arithmetic operators such as +, -, *, and / to allow for easy manipulation and calculation of quantities with units. 
The class also overloads comparison operators such as ==, !=, <, <=, >, and >= to allow for comparison of quantities with the same units.

With the UnitValue class, it is easy to perform calculations involving physical quantities while keeping track of the units involved. 
This can help reduce the likelihood of errors in calculations and improve the clarity and readability of code.
